title: "Sensitivity Analysis on the Sizing Parameters of a Series-Parallel HEV"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-06-26-conference-paper-IFAC-1
excerpt: As an alternative to power-split hybrid architectures, a simple series-parallel architecture named SPHEV 2 can be realized. In this paper, the sizing process of this architecture is briefly presented and a deeper analysis is made. Mathematical sensitivity analysis studies are conducted on the sizing parameters of the architecture in order to bring more understanding to the optimization results. Local and global sensitivities are performed to understand the influence of the sizing variables on the fuel consumption. An analysis of the sensitivities is also made.

As an alternative to power-split hybrid architectures, a simple series-parallel architecture named SPHEV 2 can be realized. In this paper, the sizing process of this architecture is briefly presented and a deeper analysis is made. Mathematical sensitivity analysis studies are conducted on the sizing parameters of the architecture in order to bring more understanding to the optimization results. Local and global sensitivities are performed to understand the influence of the sizing variables on the fuel consumption. An analysis of the sensitivities is also made.
