excerpt: Increasing speed of electric machine leads to high losses especially in stator winding assembly due to eddy currents effect. Commonly adopted formula for AC losses calculation tends to be applicable in the case of sinusoidal flux density. In this paper, a hybrid model predicting AC winding loss is presented based on one slot per pole of surface-mounted permanent-magnet machines using two formula taking into account the true flux density waveform. The results obtained comply with finite-elements results. The hybrid model was also used to investigate the influence of tooth-tip on AC losses.

Increasing speed of electric machine leads to high losses especially in stator winding assembly due to eddy currents effect. Commonly adopted formula for AC losses calculation tends to be applicable in the case of sinusoidal flux density. In this paper, a hybrid model predicting AC winding loss is presented based on one slot per pole of surface-mounted permanent-magnet machines using two formula taking into account the true flux density waveform. The results obtained comply with finite-elements results. The hybrid model was also used to investigate the influence of tooth-tip on AC losses.
