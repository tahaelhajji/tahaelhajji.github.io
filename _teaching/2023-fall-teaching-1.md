[Link to the course](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=39476)

Content
======
The purpose of this laboratory work is to understand the basics of a three phase transformer.
Three experiments are performed: No Load, Short-Circuit, and On Load (resistance, inductance, and capacitance).
Caracteristics of the transformer are determined based on the experimental results. 

WorkLoad
