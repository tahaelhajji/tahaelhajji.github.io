Proximity effect in conductors are due to an external magnetic field that induces eddy currents. These eddy currents generate losses named 'Proximity Effect Losses' or 'Strand-Level Proximity-Effect Losses'. The family tree of the models is represented in the figure below. This <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366258" target="_blank">article</a> reviews and classifies the main models in the literature allowing for the evaluation of proximity effect losses in conductors for both circular and rectangular shapes. You can choose the suitable model for your application.

For high frequency each effect, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366258" target="_blank">prior comparisons</a> reveal the optimal model offering a good trade-off between computation time and accuracy:
- Skin Effect: Analytical Models are fast and provide accurate results.
- Proximity Effect: Analytical Models can be used when considering Armature Reaction only. For On Load condition, Hybrid Models are indispensable to account for various sources of magnetic field in cases of random geometry and frequency.
- Circulating Currents: Finite Element coupled with a Circuit Model is unavoidable in cases of random geometry and frequency.

The use of new technologies (high fill factor, high current density, and thin laminations) with speed lower than $20,000 rpm$ is a better alternative for high power density regarding the traditional automotive bearing limitations. Research work need to be focused on cooling techniques to evacuate high losses due to increased current density and fill factor.
