I'm Taha.  
This is my official website.  

I graduated with a PhD in Electrical Engineering in March 2023 from <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en" target="_blank">École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay</a>, a member of <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en" target="_blank">Paris-Saclay University</a>.

I am currently Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en" target="_blank">Aalto University</a>, working on high speed electric machines for transport electrification.

Open for meaningful collaboration around the globe.
