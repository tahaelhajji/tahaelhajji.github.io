I'm Taha. This is my official website.

I am researcher on Electric Machines mainly focusing on high-speed application, high-frequency losses in windings. I am designing machines for transport electrification (e.g. Electric Vehicles, Electric Aircrafts).
I graduated with a PhD in Electrical Engineering in March 2023 from <a href="https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en">École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay</a>, a faculty of <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en">Paris-Saclay University</a>.

I am currently working on the design and optimization of high speed electric machines for transport electrification.

Open for meaningful collaboration around the globe.
